ZipZapZag_js project 
-----------------------------
Hey
This game by no means a complete game , it is only MVP . for learning purpose .
Tested on visual studio code ( the javascript IDE )  and chrome browser .

General set up 
1 .Create new cocos2d-x js project
2. Replace the Classes Directory And Resources\Images .  you can use the Resources\Images from ZipZapZag_cpp project 
3. i included the Visual Studio Code project file .vscode\launch.json , as this is configured to be used to Debug the project .
change it to your localhost url where it is now :
"url": "http://localhost:8080/cpp/2d/cocos2d-x-3.11.1/cocos2d-x-3.11.1/projects/ZipZagZapJS",
4. disable cache in chrome ( just tip)
